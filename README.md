### Description
A template for a retail store which uses fictional products to demonstrate the functionality. The current theme is The Lord of the Rings.

There are two faces to our site: a side for patrons to view and buy our fictional goods, and a side for our employees to add new products, see archived orders, as well as view or fulfill pending orders.

Our site lists fictional and fun placeholder products, but it can be easily adapted to meet the needs of any company or organization. We can quickly and conveniently adapt the front-end appearance, as well as add any database of products to fit the needs of prospective retailers.

Deployed at [Heroku](https://middleearthsupplier.herokuapp.com/).
